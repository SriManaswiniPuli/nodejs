## AUGUST 5

- Anything running in the callstack is called "Block Operation"
- Synchronous code blocks the asynchronous code
- Node.js Bindings are responsible for OS Operations
- os,fs(file systems are prsent in node js bindings)
- Libuv translates into os commands wherever it is runned
- abstracted methods so that large applications can be build easily
- Libuv works like jvm(which coverts into java code irrespective of os)
- Nodejs developers use libuv
